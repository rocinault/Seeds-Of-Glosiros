# Seeds-Of-Glosiros
My first ever project developed in Unity back in 2017, a local 2D multiplayer fighting game. Players must defeat their opponents by knocking them into the environment.
The code is awful and uses the old unity input system, which was a massive pain trying to setup up and get four controllers to work correctly. 
Needless so say I don't recommond trying to run it.
